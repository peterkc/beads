# Beads Research

This directory is an **orphan branch** (`research`) in peterkc/beads, not part of the main codebase.

## Purpose

Research and exploration for beads contributions. Notes, experiments, and investigations before committing to implementation.

## Git Context

```
Branch: research (orphan)
Remote: peterkc/beads
```

**Important**: This is a separate git history from `main`. Commits here don't appear in the main branch and vice versa.

## Session Close

Standard git workflow (no beads sync needed):

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "..."
git push origin research
```
