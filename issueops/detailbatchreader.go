// DetailBatchReader reads many issue-detail views from one consistent snapshot.
// It is a separate role rather than a method appended to Reader: Reader.Get
// still answers one ID, whereas this role preserves an ordered batch, repeats
// and per-item absence without making the caller assemble several snapshots.
//
// Successful items match Reader.Get on the same route and options, including
// relation multiplicity and plane selection. Relation rows come in a fixed
// order: the batch keeps Reader.Get's sort keys where it has them and breaks
// ties by edge, and it sorts by edge where Reader.Get leaves the order to the
// database. Subjects are durable-first. Edge counts include all types across
// both edge tables and sum duplicates. Optional rows, parent, epic progress, brief dependencies, comment
// omission and revision retain the existing detail-view semantics.
//
// This is a read: it changes no rows, records no history and fires no completion
// hooks. Implementations snapshot the request without mutating caller-owned
// values. Validation failures match ErrValidation. An empty list and invalid
// IDs return before opening a transaction; every other failed read returns an
// error and no items. Ordinary JSON bd show uses this role for local exact-ID
// reads. GET /v0/beads/issues:batchGet serves it with a transport-only bound of
// 1 to 100 IDs and the same detail options as getIssue.
